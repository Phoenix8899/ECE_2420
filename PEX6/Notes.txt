	look at crypto factory 

	needs a derived class, becuase there is a pure virtual 
	
	//im not sure if action function needs to be made 

	
	steps:
	make platter needs to make n heads //static is like a global function that all derived classes can do.
	
	execute
	{
	if self or left or right is !locked

	//figure out each constuctor so that it has its own mutex and is aware of arm to its left and right.
	
	lock mutex left right and self

	do stuff 

	unlock left right and self
	}

	//can only write if all three are unlocked.

	//execute is a pure virtual, that means there is another class for some reason? but why and what does it do?

	//call the base header in the derived header init list

	//derived class to make anything n stuffs
